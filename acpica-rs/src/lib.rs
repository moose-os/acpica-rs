//! ACPICA Rust bindings library
//!
//! This library provides Rust bindings for the ACPICA (ACPI Component Architecture) library,
//! enabling Rust programs to interact with the ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)
//! subsystem.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `AcpicaOsServices` trait defines the required interface that must be implemented to
//! allow ACPICA to function in a specific operating system environment. Implementations of
//! this trait are responsible for providing OS-specific services such as memory management,
//! thread synchronization, and I/O operations.
//!
//! The global OS services implementation is set once using the `set_os_services_implementation`
//! function, which ensures that the ACPICA subsystem has access to the necessary system resources
//! to operate correctly. Once set, this implementation cannot be changed for the lifetime of the
//! system.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Thread Safety:** The OS services implementation is stored in a thread-safe manner using
//!   the `Once` primitive, ensuring that it is initialized only once.
//! - **Customizable OS Services:** Developers can provide custom implementations of the
//!   `AcpicaOsServices` trait to tailor the ACPI interactions to their specific OS environment.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To use this library, you need to implement the `AcpicaOsServices` trait for your target
//! operating system. Then, set your implementation using `set_os_services_implementation`
//! before performing any ACPI-related operations.
//!
//! Example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! let my_os_services = Box::new(MyAcpicaOsServicesImplementation::new());
//! set_os_services_implementation(my_os_services);
//! ```
//!
//! In the example above, `MyAcpicaOsServicesImplementation` is a custom struct that implements
//! the `AcpicaOsServices` trait. The ACPI subsystem will use this implementation to interface
//! with the underlying OS.
//!
//! # Notes
//! This library is `no_std` and is intended to be used in environments where the standard
//! library is not available. The crate depends on the `alloc` crate for dynamic memory
//! allocation.
